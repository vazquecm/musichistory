This version is after getting off of vagrant and getting everything back onto local machine.  Having issues so nothing works as of 11/22/15.  
Yay! Got all files in correct path.  

Finally got the filter button to work!  It now loads what the user has selected from the option boxes. 

done -- Use jQuery to retrieve the songs from your API.  
done -- Use the JSON objects to populate Handlebar templates.  
done -- Use the populated templates to update the browser.  
done -- Add new songs to your Firebase API with POST AJAX calls.  
done -- Populate the form fields with data from your API. 
done -- When "Filter" button is pressed, update the song list with songs that only match the specified criteria.  

The delete button is now functional.  The user can now delete a song, artist, and album from the DOM, although the information is still maintained in the firebase database.
